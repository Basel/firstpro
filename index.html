								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
							
								<p>I'm currently second year ICT student, majoring Business IT & Management at the Hanze University of Applied Science in Groningen, the Netherlands. Previously, I studied English Translation in Homs University for three years, in 2009 I started my online translation business (Victoria LTS) and developed my skills as a video subtitler and worked as freelance subtitler for 5 years. </p>

								<p>I’m originally from Syria and was born in 1989, I live now in Groningen, I speak Arabic (Native), English, Dutch and Esperanto; and due to the fact that my subtitling job allowed me to work on different languages, I’m very familiar to confidently work on different languages such as: Greek, Polish and Spanish. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Skills & Projects</h2>
								
								<p>Even though subtitling was my career for years, I'm eager these days to build and develop my ICT skills and be prepared for my soon-future career as a project manager or business architect. Studying at Hanze is giving me the necessary skills to land in a career confidently.  </p>
<p> Some of the project and the skills I have learnt/done are: <br>
	- Web development using HTML/CSS/PHP/MYSQL.  <br>
	- Data analysis and data visualization via Tableau.  <br>
	- Setting up a business case in PRINCE2 framework. <br>
	- Enterprise architecture using TOGAF framework.  <br>

							<article id="subtitle">
								<h2 class="major">Subtitling Services</h2>
								
								<p>My work was outsourced to several companies such as: Netflix and SONY, I also worked for different individual clients such as: <a href="http://easydaf.de">EasyDaf</a>, GUT protocol, Irish media, <a href="http://www.healthandperformance.com.au/">Health & Performance by Gavin Heward</a> and have in my account more than 30.000 minutes subtitled in 5 languages (English, Arabic, Dutch, German and Spanish). Beside subtitling services, I also trained nearly 100 Arabic-speaking students on subtitling via ATIDA. </p>
								<p>My subtitling services cover all subtitling aspects, starting from transcribing, translation, timecoding, proofreading and embedding. I also offer customized subtitle service such as karaoke, captioning and SLS (Same-language subtitle). High quality is always guaranteed. </p>

								<p> If you want to order a subtitle, please contact me and tell me about your video(s)  </p>

														<h2 class="major">Podcast</h2>
														<p>I’m not a podcast producer nor appeared in any podcast (Except the two records I once made in Arabic giving tips on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/basel-amro/how-to-learn-english">how to learn English </a> and another one where I’m explaining <a href="https://soundcloud.com/basel-amro/vyunalizhcfm">the Dutch education system for Arabic speakers</a>), but people who know me personally, likely know that I’m addicted to listen to podcasts, I use it as a way to feed my curiosity, expand my knowledge and learn more about science, human psychology and world; I use podcast as an alternative to books. And since I’m often asked to recommend some shows, I decided to add a page to my own website showing my top podcasts, here we are!</p> <br>
